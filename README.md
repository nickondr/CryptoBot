# CryptoBot

This program uses Binance and Bitmex API to send and receive trade orders automatically through their systems. 
This program is still in development and should not be used on anything other than the testnet.
In order for marketable trades to be executed, the user must first sync their system's time with the network.

For any questions regarding the use and implemmentation of this program, please feel free to email me at nwondr@gmail.com

Thanks,
